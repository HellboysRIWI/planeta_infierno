            <h3>introduction:</h3>
            <p>The start: The world was born from the corpse of a colossal being, ancient beyond the reach of time. From its remains, the first creatures crawled into existence, claiming its vast body as their homeland. They carved their cities from its flesh and shaped their fortresses from its bones—monuments built upon suffering and steeped in despair.
            Fire itself is but a byproduct of the world’s ceaseless torment, sparked by the unending cycle of brutality that reigns over this chaotic realm.
            Driven by everlasting agony, its inhabitants spiral into perpetual violence, feeding the eternal flame that scorches them without mercy. Their hierarchy is forged in crude, anarchic royalty, a twisted court where tyranny rules absolute and chaos crowns the throne.
