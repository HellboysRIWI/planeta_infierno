Bestiary of the Colossus and Hell
General Description

This project documents the species, hierarchies, and entities that inhabit the Colossus and the different levels of Hell. It includes biological, technological, and hierarchical descriptions, as well as the role each creature plays within its ecosystem. The purpose is to create a coherent and organized record for narrative, artistic, or technical use.

Main Features

Complete classification of species according to their habitat.

Defined power systems and hierarchies.

Detailed descriptions with an anatomical and functional focus.

Inclusion of technological implants and natural mutations.

Clear differentiation between creatures of the Colossus and creatures of Hell.

Higher hierarchies and entities of maximum authority.

Documented Species
1. Umbratron

Power level: Moderately strong

Hierarchical level: None

Habitat: Intestine of the Colossus

Description:
The Umbratron is a species conceived inside the Colossus’ intestine. Its legs are adapted to efficiently move across slippery surfaces. Its wide, sensitive eyes allow it to see in complete darkness. It possesses technological implants that grant it a head-mounted cannon.

2. Suspicus

Power level: Dangerously strong

Hierarchical rank: Caretakers of chaos

Habitat: Upper part of the Colossus’ skin

Description:
Its large fat layer serves as protection against the low temperatures of the Colossus’ surface. Both arms have been amputated and replaced with integrated cannons. It moves slowly, but its offensive power makes it extremely lethal.

3. Entity of Maximum Infernal Hierarchy

Hierarchical level: Highest hierarchy in Hell

Description:
This entity rules the levels of Hell with absolute authority. Its presence marks the highest point of the infernal order and serves as a central figure around which the entire hierarchy is structured. Its massive, distorted physical form reflects the power accumulated over eras.

Instructions for Use
